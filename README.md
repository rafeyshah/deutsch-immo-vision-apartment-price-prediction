# **Deutsch Immo Vision: German Apartment Price Prediction**

## **Project Overview**
**Deutsch-Immo-Vision** aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict apartment rental prices across Germany. Using comprehensive apartment data, we explore the influence of features like location, property size, amenities, and energy efficiency on rental prices. This end-to-end project encompasses data processing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment through a RESTful API, making predictions accessible to end-users.

## **Objective**
The primary goal is to create a production-ready model that:
- Accurately predicts rental prices for German apartments based on detailed property and location features.
- Provides a scalable, deployable solution accessible via an API.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository_link>
cd Deutsch-Immo-Vision
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv deutsch_immo_vision_env
source deutsch_immo_vision_env/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
# or
.\deutsch_immo_vision_env\Scriptsctivate   # On Windows
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Configuration**
In the `configs` folder, the `config.yaml` file stores project-specific configurations like data paths, model hyperparameters, and file-saving options.

Example `config.yaml`:
```yaml
data_path: "data/"
model_path: "artifacts/"
hyperparameters:
  learning_rate: 0.01
  max_depth: 5
  n_estimators: 100
  random_state: 42
```

### **5. Run the Project Pipeline**
To execute the full pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

## **Project Workflow**

### **Step 1: Data Collection and Processing**
   - Clean and preprocess the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
   - Structure key features to be compatible with modeling requirements.

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
   - Extract and enhance meaningful features, especially for location, property size, and age.
   - Convert categorical columns (e.g., location) to numeric formats through encoding techniques.

### **Step 3: Model Development**
   - Develop baseline and advanced machine learning models.
   - Use techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
   - Compare multiple algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for the best results.

### **Step 4: Deployment**
   - Deploy the model as a RESTful API using FastAPI, allowing end-users to make predictions based on property details.
   - Use Docker to containerize the application, enabling scalable deployment.

### **Step 5: Model Evaluation and Optimization**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
   - Use SHAP or LIME for model interpretability to understand the influence of each feature on predictions.
